Funding agencies and the scientific community have been putting enormous efforts into studying the impact of these changes.

In the natural system the balance among carbon in the atmosphere, land and ocean is regulated through fluxes between these three main reservoirs. In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades. Understanding the patterns of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean and land and the processes associated to them such as CO2 fertilization, ocean acidification, changes in surface runoff of sediments, changes to wetlands and peatlands, warming of permafrost, and changes to natural disturbance regimes, are critical to improving knowledge of the carbon cycle, its direct and indirect impacts on society and identifying approaches to mitigate and adapt for its consequences.",image:_,thumbnail:_,website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F31\u002Fa-collaboration-on-carbon-science-just-kicked-off\u002F",technicalOfficer:v,variablesNumber:$,projectsNumber:$},{id:"magnetosphere_ionosphere",name:"Magnetosphere Ionosphere",description:"All magnetic objects produce invisible lines of force that extend between the poles of the object. Earth is similar to a giant bar magnet with magnetic field lines radiating from the south to the north magnetic pole. Charged particles become trapped on these field lines, forming the Earth's magnetosphere. However, Earth's magnetic field lines are not symmetric with respect to its magnetic axis, unlike those of a bar magnet. The impact of a continuous stream of solar particles (the solar wind) causes the lines facing the Sun to be compressed. The field lines facing away from the Sun get stretched and elongated, forming the Earth's magnetotail. The bullet shaped magnetic bubble formed by the terrestrial magnetic field lines is called the Earth's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere extends into the vacuum of space, on average, from approximately 60 000 kilometres sunward, and trails out more than 300 000 kilometres away from the Sun in the magnetotail.",image:aa,thumbnail:aa,website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fsearch\u002Fmagnetosphere",technicalOfficer:v,variablesNumber:ab,projectsNumber:ab},{id:"oceans",name:"Oceans",description:"Society is facing today a number of global environmental challenges requiring the better understanding and monitoring of the interconnected Earth System processes.

To fill these gaps, dedicated research activities are needed, embracing a large number of disciplines as physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, ecology, and further exploring the interaction of the ocean with the other components of the Earth System, in particular the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere.
