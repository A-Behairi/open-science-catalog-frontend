mean sea level rise is one of the most direct consequences of actual global warming. Since the beginning of the 20th century, global mean sea level experiences an unabated increase of 1.1-1.9 mm.yr-1 recorded by tide gauges. Based on satellite altimetry and since 1993, global mean sea level rises at a higher rate of 3 mm.yr-1. This higher rate denotes a possible acceleration in this global rise. Actual global mean sea level rise mainly reflects global ocean warming (through thermal expansion of sea water) and land ice melt (from Greenland, Antarctica and mountain glaciers). Monitoring precisely these climate variables is mandatory to better understand processes at work under current global warming and to validate climate models used for projections. The OVALIE project proposes to scientifically investigate and partition the respective contribution of the atmospheric forced variability versus the oceanic intrinsic variability for the sea level observations (satellite data -based on Topex\u002FPoseidon, Jason 1-2-3, ERS1, ERS2, ENVISAT, Altika and GRACE- and in situ measurements –based on Argo floats and other in situ measurements).","osc:name":bp,"osc:themes":[y],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:I,"e-mail":J},"osc:consortium":[au],"osc:type":K,start_datetime:bq,end_datetime:ag,datetime:br},geometry:A,links:[{rel:k,href:av,title:L},{rel:k,href:av,title:M},{rel:C,href:z,type:a},{rel:u,href:n,type:a},{rel:D,href:aN,type:a},{rel:E,href:n,type:a}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-116.xml",roles:[N]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bn[2]={type:H,stac_version:B,id:"project-66",properties:{title:"(LPF) PHYSIOGLOB",description:"Assessing the inter-annual physiological response of phytoplankton to global warming using long-term satellite observations","osc:name":"PHYSIOGLOB: Assessing the inter-annual physiological response of phytoplankton to global warming using long-term satellite observations","osc:themes":[y],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:I,"e-mail":J},"osc:consortium":["ITALIAN NATIONAL AGENCY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES","ENERGY AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (ENEA) (IT)"],"osc:type":K,start_datetime:"2018-10-01",end_datetime:ag,datetime:"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z"},geometry:A,links:[{rel:k,href:bs,title:L},{rel:k,href:bs,title:M},{rel:C,href:z,type:a},{rel:u,href:n,type:a},{rel:D,href:aM,type:a},{rel:E,href:n,type:a}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-66.xml",roles:[N]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bn[3]={type:H,stac_version:B,id:"project-98",properties:{title:"(LPF) SMOWS",description:"How salinity impacts the formation of sub-surface waters (Mode Waters) in the South-West Pacific Ocean","osc:name":"SMOWS: Satellite Mode Waters Salinity, in synergy with Temperature and Sea Level","osc:themes":[y],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:I,"e-mail":J},"osc:consortium":[au],"osc:type":K,start_datetime:"2018-10-09",end_datetime:ag,datetime:"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z"},geometry:A,links:[{rel:k,href:bt,title:L},{rel:k,href:bt,title:M},{rel:C,href:z,type:a},{rel:u,href:n,type:a},{rel:D,href:bj,type:a},{rel:E,href:n,type:a}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-98.xml",roles:[N]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bn[4]={type:H,stac_version:B,id:"project-6",properties:{title:"AEOLUS+INNOVATION -

The output will be a GOV-ST Observation Impact Statement Report focussed on satellite SSS, journal publications and a workshop dedicated to the findings and approach taken by the study team.","osc:name":"GODAE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM EVALUATION OF SATELLITE SEA SURFACE SALINITY AND EL NINO 2015 (SMOS-NINO15)","osc:themes":[y],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:I,"e-mail":J},"osc:consortium":[aj,"Mercator Ocean International (FR)","MetOffice (GB)"],"osc:type":K,start_datetime:"2016-07-27",end_datetime:"2019-05-15",datetime:"2016-07-27T00:00:00Z"},geometry:A,links:[{rel:k,href:"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.godae-oceanview.org\u002Fscience\u002Ftask-teams\u002Fobserving-system-evaluation-tt-oseval-tt\u002F",title:L},{rel:k,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fgodae-ocean-observing-system-evaluation-of-satellite-sea-surface-salinity-and-el-nino-2015-smos-nino15\u002F",title:M},{rel:C,href:z,type:a},{rel:u,href:n,type:a},{rel:D,href:be,type:a},{rel:E,href:n,type:a}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-47.xml",roles:[N]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bn[28]={type:H,stac_version:B,id:"project-118",properties:{title:bT,description:"The objectives of this activity are to (i) develop and validate innovative methodologies allowing to optimize the synergetic capacity offered by satellite data, in situ measurements and numerical models for improving the retrieval of upper-layer ocean circulation products over 4 high-priority pilot areas chosen as to represent at best the diversity of the world ocean circulation regimes, i.e. one polar sea area, one western boundary current, one upwelling region, one coastal area, and ii) in line with the objectives of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, demonstrate the unique capacity of the innovative products to support effective actions aiming at procuring a clean, safe, sustainably harvested and productive ocean by targeting FOUR high priority pilot applications, i.e. Pollution Monitoring, Safe Navigation, Sustainable Fisheries and Renewable Marine Energies.","osc:name":bT,"osc:themes":[y],"osc:status":aw,"osc:technical_officer":{name:I,"e-mail":J},"osc:consortium":[bP,ai,"CNR-RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GEO-HYDROLOGICAL PROTECTION – IRPI (IT)",aF,aB,"Ocean Next (FR)","Universiteit Utrecht (NL)"],"osc:type":K,start_datetime:"2020-04-28",end_datetime:"2022-05-31",datetime:"2020-04-28T00:00:00Z"},geometry:A,links:[{rel:k,href:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.worldoceancirculation.org\u002F",title:L},{rel:k,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fworld-ocean-circulation\u002F",title:M},{rel:C,href:z,type:a},{rel:u,href:n,type:a},{rel:D,href:a$,type:a},{rel:E,href:n,type:a}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-118.xml",roles:[N]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bU[0]=bV;bU[1]=bW;bU[2]=bX;bU[3]=bY;bU[4]=bZ;bU[5]=b_;bU[6]=b$;bU[7]=ca;bU[8]=cb;bU[9]=cc;bU[10]=cd;bU[11]=cf;bU[12]=cg;bU[13]=ch;bU[14]=ci;bU[15]=cj;bU[16]=ck;bU[17]=cl;bU[18]=cm;bU[19]=cn;bU[20]=co;bU[21]=cp;bU[22]=cq;bU[23]=cr;bU[24]=cs;bU[25]=ct;bU[26]=cv;bV.name="Bathymetry";bV.description="Underwater depth and information on the morphology of the seafloor";bV.summary={years:[h,i,f],numberOfProducts:X};bW.name="Geophysical Correction - ionosphere";bW.description=aG;bW.summary={years:[],numberOfProducts:m};bX.name="Geophysical Correction - regional tides";bX.description=aG;bX.summary={years:[f],numberOfProducts:o};bY.name="Geophysical Correction - wet troposphere";bY.description=aG;bY.summary={years:[e,h,i,f,g,b,c,d,l,r,P],numberOfProducts:o};bZ.name="High Resolution Coastal Zone Altimetry";bZ.description=az;bZ.summary={years:[],numberOfProducts:m};b_.name="High Resolution Polar Ocean Altimetry";b_.description=az;b_.summary={years:[],numberOfProducts:m};b$.name="Inorganic carbon";b$.description="The ocean is a major component of the global carbon cycle, absorbing enormous quantities of carbon in natural cycles driven by the ocean circulation, biogeochemistry and biology.

Change in the global mean sea level provides a measure of the net change in ocean mass due to melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and net change in ocean volume due to thermal expansion. Sea level observations characterize inter-seasonal variability such as ENSO. On the regional scales, changes in sea level can be far larger than the globally averaged value due to changes in temperature, salinity and circulation. Along many continental margins vertical land displacement associated with crustal adjustments to past and current land ice melt also cause regional variations in apparent sea level independent of the ocean.

To fill these gaps, dedicated research activities are needed, embracing a large number of disciplines as physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, ecology, and further exploring the interaction of the ocean with the other components of the Earth System, in particular the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere.
