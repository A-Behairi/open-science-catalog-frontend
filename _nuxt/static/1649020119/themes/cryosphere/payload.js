The primary parameters that define the state of sea ice include: concentration, area and extent, ice type, motion, deformation, age, thickness, and volume. The presence of sea ice strongly modifies surface waves and air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum, moisture and gases. Sea ice has a significant impact on the Earth’s albedo and hence changes in Sea Ice impact the global energy budget. The properties of many water masses of the global ocean and strongly influenced determined freezing and melting processes in sea ice regions. https:\u002F\u002Fgcos.wmo.int\u002Fen\u002Fessential-climate-variables\u002Fsea-ice",{},{},{},18,25,20,14,7,11)));
