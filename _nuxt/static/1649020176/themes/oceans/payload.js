However, knowledge gaps remain in order to better understand, characterize and monitor its role in all major Earth System global cycles (e.g. water, energy, gas, and in particular carbon, momentum cycles…). To fill these gaps, dedicated research activities are needed, embracing a large number of disciplines as physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, ecology, and further exploring the interaction of the ocean with the other components of the Earth System, in particular the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere. To make the best of it, this research shall be based on the optimal and synergistic exploitation of all available observing systems (EO satellite data, in-situ and citizen observations), advanced modelling capabilities, interdisciplinary research and new technologies.","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F11\u002Fcollaboration-ocean-science\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-10.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-66.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-63.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-75.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-25.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-92.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-28.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-6.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-61.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-95.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-85.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-49.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-8.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-21.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-26.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-118.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-24.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-23.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-17.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-27.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-47.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-59.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-62.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-42.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-34.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-98.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-7.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-22.json",".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Oceans.webp",Array(28),"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fovalie-oceanic-intrinsic-variability-versus-atmospheric-forced-variability-of-sea-level-change\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fphysioglob\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fsmows-satellite-mode-waters-salinity-in-synergy-with-temperature-and-sea-level\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Faeolus-innovation-ocean-sub-surface-products-and-applications\u002F","CNR-RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GEO-HYDROLOGICAL PROTECTION ‚ IRPI (IT)","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Faeolus-innovation-expro-cdom-proxy-retrieval-from-aeolus-observations-color\u002F","Verisk Analytics GmbH (DE)","KNMI (NL)","Arctic + Salinity","BALTIC+ SEAL - Sea Level","DANISH METEOROLOGICAL INSTITUTE (DK)","TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF DENMARK (DK)","UNIVERSITY COLLEGE CORK (IE)","http:\u002F\u002Fbalticseal.eu\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fbaltic-seal-sea-level\u002F","BALTIC+ Salinity Dynamics","Land","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fthemes\u002Fland.json","PLYMOUTH MARINE LABORATORY (GB)","HELLENIC CENTRE FOR MARINE RESEARCH (HCMR) (GR)","SATELLITE OCEANOGRAPHIC CONSULTANTS LTD.

The primary parameters that define the state of sea ice include: concentration, area and extent, ice type, motion, deformation, age, thickness, and volume. The presence of sea ice strongly modifies surface waves and air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum, moisture and gases. Sea ice has a significant impact on the Earth’s albedo and hence changes in Sea Ice impact the global energy budget. The properties of many water masses of the global ocean and strongly influenced determined freezing and melting processes in sea ice regions. https:\u002F\u002Fgcos.wmo.int\u002Fen\u002Fessential-climate-variables\u002Fsea-ice")));
