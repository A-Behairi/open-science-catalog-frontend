CISAR is an advanced mathematical method developed by Rayference for the joint retrieval of surface reflectance and atmospheric (cloud and aerosols) properties from observations acquired by space-based imagers.The CISAR algorithm relies on the FASTRE radiative transfer model that describes surface reflectance and atmospheric absorption\u002Fscattering processes. The lowest level represents the surface. The lower layer hosts the aerosols. Molecular scattering and absorption are also taking place in that layer which is radiatively coupled with the surface for both the single and the multiple scattering. The upper layer is only subject to molecular absorption.The inversion of the FASTRE model within the CISAR algorithm against satellite observations provides accurate estimates of the surface reflectance field, aerosol or cloud optical thickness and single scattering properties in each processed spectral band. An estimate of the retrieval uncertainty is also provided.As the proposed method retrieved both cloud and aerosol properties with the same retrieval algorithm, no cloud mask is needed to perform the retrieval. Additionally, the same algorithm can be applied over any type of surfaces, including dark or bright surfaces or water bodies.","osc:name":"ConsIstent Retrieval of Cloud Aerosol Surface","osc:themes":[z],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:H,"e-mail":I},"osc:consortium":["RAYFERENCE SPRL (BE)","BROCKMANN CONSULT GMBH (DE)"],"osc:type":J,start_datetime:"2017-07-17",end_datetime:"2019-10-02",datetime:"2017-07-17T00:00:00Z"},geometry:w,links:[{rel:c,href:"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.circas.eu\u002F",title:K},{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fconsistent-retrieval-of-cloud-aerosol-surface\u002F",title:L},{rel:b,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-55.json",type:a,title:"Cloud and aerosol products_Regional_S3A\u002FSLSTR"},{rel:b,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-56.json",type:a,title:"Albedo_Regional_S3A\u002FSLSTR"},{rel:b,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-57.json",type:a,title:"Radiation budget_Regional_S3"},{rel:C,href:A,type:a},{rel:t,href:f,type:a},{rel:D,href:bb,type:a},{rel:E,href:f,type:a}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-14.xml",roles:[M]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bj[12]={type:G,stac_version:B,id:"project-31",properties:{title:bz,description:"Develop and demonstrate a methodology that is capable of exploiting the various available data sources of urban air quality, to combine them in a mathematically objective and scientifically meaningful manner, and to provide value-added maps of urban air quality at high spatial resolution.","osc:name":bz,"osc:themes":[z],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:H,"e-mail":I},"osc:consortium":[ae,"NILU - NORWEGIAN INSTITUTE FOR AIR RESEARCH (NO)"],"osc:type":J,start_datetime:"2020-07-09",end_datetime:"2021-07-15",datetime:"2020-07-09T00:00:00Z"},geometry:w,links:[{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Fcitysatair.nilu.no\u002F",title:K},{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fcitysatair\u002F",title:L},{rel:C,href:A,type:a},{rel:t,href:f,type:a},{rel:D,href:aF,type:a},{rel:E,href:f,type:a}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-31.xml",roles:[M]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bj[13]={type:G,stac_version:B,id:"project-32",properties:{title:"CREST",description:"Elaborate methods to merge aerosol extinction coefficient records from solar\u002Flunar\u002Fstellar occultation and limb-scatter instruments and create a merged longterm multi-mission aerosol record.

The primary parameters that define the state of sea ice include: concentration, area and extent, ice type, motion, deformation, age, thickness, and volume. The presence of sea ice strongly modifies surface waves and air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum, moisture and gases. Sea ice has a significant impact on the Earth’s albedo and hence changes in Sea Ice impact the global energy budget. The properties of many water masses of the global ocean and strongly influenced determined freezing and melting processes in sea ice regions. https:\u002F\u002Fgcos.wmo.int\u002Fen\u002Fessential-climate-variables\u002Fsea-ice",11)));
