Level is one of the primary indicators of global climate change. Change in the global mean sea level provides a measure of the net change in ocean mass due to melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and net change in ocean volume due to thermal expansion. Sea level observations characterize inter-seasonal variability such as ENSO. On the regional scales, changes in sea level can be far larger than the globally averaged value due to changes in temperature, salinity and circulation. Along many continental margins vertical land displacement associated with crustal adjustments to past and current land ice melt also cause regional variations in apparent sea level independent of the ocean. Coastal sea level change is a major driver of societal impacts. https:\u002F\u002Fgcos.wmo.int\u002Fen\u002Fessential-climate-variables\u002Fsea-level","Radar altimetry","Earth's interior",18,25,20,14,7,"Sea ice variability is a key indicator of climate variability and change in the polar regions.

The presence of sea ice strongly modifies surface waves and air-sea exchanges of heat, momentum, moisture and gases.

Ocean is one key gearing of this complex engine. However, knowledge gaps remain in order to better understand, characterize and monitor its role in all major Earth System global cycles (e.g. water, energy, gas, and in particular carbon, momentum cycles…). To fill these gaps, dedicated research activities are needed, embracing a large number of disciplines as physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, ecology, and further exploring the interaction of the ocean with the other components of the Earth System, in particular the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere. To make the best of it, this research shall be based on the optimal and synergistic exploitation of all available observing systems (EO satellite data, in-situ and citizen observations), advanced modelling capabilities, interdisciplinary research and new technologies.",".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Oceans.webp","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F11\u002Fcollaboration-ocean-science\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fcatalog.json"));
