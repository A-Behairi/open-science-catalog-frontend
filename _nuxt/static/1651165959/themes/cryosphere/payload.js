This natural cycle has been perturbed over the past decades by the global population increase and by the related boost of anthropogenic activities. The composition of the atmosphere is undergoing major and rapid changes with significant impacts on a global scale, affecting the environment and human health. Funding agencies and the scientific community have been putting enormous efforts into studying the impact of these changes. Nonetheless, there is still a need to fill knowledge gaps and enhance the understanding of precursors and the formation mechanisms of the different atmospheric compounds and the relative contribution of biogenic and anthropogenic sources and sinks to their global budget. Such knowledge improvements shall serve as input for policy makers in order to adopt mitigation and adaptation strategies.",image:".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Atmosphere.webp",website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fcommunities\u002Fscientists\u002Fesa-atmosphere-science-cluster\u002F",summary:{years:[E,F,v,s,q,p,i,h,k,l,n,m,g,f,j,o,t,N,ax],numberOfProducts:a,numberOfProjects:a,numberOfVariables:169},variables:[{name:"Cloud ice effective radius",description:"Size distribution of ice particles, assimilated to spheres of the same volume.

In the natural system the balance among carbon in the atmosphere, land and ocean is regulated through fluxes between these three main reservoirs. In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades. Understanding the patterns of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean and land and the processes associated to them such as CO2 fertilization, ocean acidification, changes in surface runoff of sediments, changes to wetlands and peatlands, warming of permafrost, and changes to natural disturbance regimes, are critical to improving knowledge of the carbon cycle, its direct and indirect impacts on society and identifying approaches to mitigate and adapt for its consequences.",image:".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Land.webp",website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F31\u002Fa-collaboration-on-carbon-science-just-kicked-off\u002F",summary:{years:[L,E,F,v,s,q,p,i,h,k,l,n,m,g,f,j,o,t,N],numberOfProducts:a,numberOfProjects:a,numberOfVariables:35},variables:[{name:"Lake area",description:"Aera extent of the surface of a lake",summary:{years:[q,p,i,h,k,l,n,m,g,f,j,o,t,N],numberOfProducts:r}},{name:"CO2 flux",description:"Flux of carbon dioxide from the surface to the atmosphere",summary:{years:[L,E,F,v,s,q,p,i,h,k,l,n,m,g,f,j,o,t,N],numberOfProducts:r}},{name:"Wetland extent",description:"Fraction of an area flood by water",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Snow depth",description:"Vertical distance from the snow surface to the underlying surface (ground, glacier ice or sea ice).",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:r}},{name:"Fire radiative power",description:"Power radiated by the fire occurring within an area",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Fraction of vegetated land",description:"Fraction of a land area where vegetation is present",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Lake Surface Temperature",description:"Temperature of the lake surface - Physical unit: [ K ] - Accuracy unit: [ K ].",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Land cover",description:"Processed from land surface imagery by assigning identified cluster(s) within a given area to specific classes of objects - Accuracy expressed as number of classes.
