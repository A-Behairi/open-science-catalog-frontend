The project is planned for 2.5 years, starting in Sept. 2019. It gathers partners from 5 institutes (ISTerre Grenoble; ETH Zurich; Leeds University; IPG Paris, DTU Copenhagen).

Our focus is on sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events, during which the middle atmosphere (10-85 km) is highly disturbed. The ionosphere response to SSWs has previously been studied for low latitude regions, where forcing from the magnetosphere is indirect and relatively modest. VERA will assess the importance of vertical atmospheric coupling at mid- and high- latitudes, using observations from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground-based radars, as well as state-of-the-art numerical models. The conclusions derived from the analyses of these data can lead to a significant breakthrough on driving forces of the ionospheric weather.","osc:name":"SWARM+ COUPLING: HIGH-LOW ATMOSPHERE INTERACTIONS: VERtical coupling in Earth's Atmosphere at mid and high latitudes (VERA)","osc:themes":[M],"osc:status":aa,"osc:technical_officer":{name:_,"e-mail":$},"osc:consortium":["HELMHOLTZ-ZENTRUM POTSDAM – DEUTSCHES GEOFORSCHUNGZENTRUM (GFZ) (DE)","Research Centre Rez (CZ)","UNIVERSITY OF NEW BRUNSWICK (CA)"],"osc:type":W,start_datetime:af,end_datetime:"2020-11-30",datetime:ag},geometry:O,links:[{rel:H,href:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.gfz-potsdam.de\u002Fen\u002Fsection\u002Fgeomagnetism\u002Fprojects\u002Farchive\u002Fvera-vertical-coupling-in-earths-atmosphere-at-mid-and-high-latitudes\u002F#c65013",title:X},{rel:H,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fswarm-coupling-high-low-atmosphere-interactions-vertical-coupling-in-earths-atmosphere-at-mid-and-high-latitudes-vera\u002F",title:Y},{rel:y,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-164.json",type:b,title:"Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW)"},{rel:Q,href:N,type:b},{rel:L,href:I,type:b},{rel:R,href:av,type:b},{rel:S,href:I,type:b}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-121.xml",roles:[Z]}},stac_extensions:[T]};aB[0]=aC;aB[1]=aD;aB[2]=aE;aB[3]=aF;aB[4]=aG;aB[5]=aH;aB[6]=aI;aB[7]=aJ;aB[8]=aK;aB[9]=aL;aB[10]=aM;aB[11]=aN;aB[12]=aO;aB[13]=aP;aB[14]=aQ;aB[15]=aR;aB[16]=aS;aB[17]=aT;aB[18]=aU;aB[19]=aV;aB[20]=aW;aB[21]=aX;aB[22]=aY;aB[23]=aZ;aB[24]=a_;aB[25]=a$;aB[26]=ba;aB[27]=bb;aB[28]=bc;aB[29]=bd;aB[30]=be;aB[31]=bf;aB[32]=bg;aB[33]=bh;aB[34]=bi;aB[35]=bj;aB[36]=bk;aB[37]=bl;aB[38]=bm;aB[39]=bn;aB[40]=bo;aB[41]=bp;aB[42]=bq;aB[43]=br;aB[44]=bs;aB[45]=bt;aB[46]=bu;aB[47]=bv;aB[48]=bw;aB[49]=bx;aB[50]=by;aB[51]=bz;aB[52]=bA;aB[53]=bB;aB[54]=bC;aB[55]=bD;aB[56]=bE;aB[57]=bF;aB[58]=bG;aB[59]=bH;aB[60]=bI;aB[61]=bJ;aB[62]=bK;aB[63]=bL;aB[64]=bM;aB[65]=bN;aB[66]=bO;aB[67]=bP;aB[68]=bQ;aB[69]=bR;aB[70]=bS;aB[71]=bT;aB[72]=bU;aB[73]=bV;aB[74]=bW;aB[75]=bX;aB[76]=bY;aB[77]=bZ;aB[78]=b_;aB[79]=b$;aB[80]=ca;aB[81]=cb;aB[82]=cc;aB[83]=cd;aC.name="Alpha particles differential directional flux";aC.description=ak;aC.summary={years:[],numberOfProducts:a};aD.name="Alpha particles integral directional flux";aD.description="An alpha particle has positive charge and consists of two protons and two neutrons (the nucleus of a helium atom).

In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades.
