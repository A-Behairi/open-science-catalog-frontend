In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades. Understanding the patterns of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean and land and the processes associated to them such as CO2 fertilization, ocean acidification, changes in surface runoff of sediments, changes to wetlands and peatlands, warming of permafrost, and changes to natural disturbance regimes, are critical to improving knowledge of the carbon cycle, its direct and indirect impacts on society and identifying approaches to mitigate and adapt for its consequences.",image:".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Land.webp",website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F31\u002Fa-collaboration-on-carbon-science-just-kicked-off\u002F",summary:{years:[t,r,s,q,o,m,l,e,d,g,h,j,i,c,b,f,k,p,u],numberOfProducts:a,numberOfProjects:a,numberOfVariables:35},variables:[{name:"Snow status (wet\u002Fdry)",description:"Binary product (dry or melting\u002Fthawing) expressing the presence of liquid water in a snow layer- Accuracy expressed as Hit Rate [ HR ] and False Alarm Rate [ FAR ].",summary:{years:[b,f],numberOfProducts:n}},{name:"Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)",description:"Difference between maximum (in NIR) and minimum (around the Red) vegetation reflectance, normalised to the summation.

Charged particles become trapped on these field lines, forming the Earth's magnetosphere. However, Earth's magnetic field lines are not symmetric with respect to its magnetic axis, unlike those of a bar magnet. The impact of a continuous stream of solar particles (the solar wind) causes the lines facing the Sun to be compressed. The field lines facing away from the Sun get stretched and elongated, forming the Earth's magnetotail. The bullet shaped magnetic bubble formed by the terrestrial magnetic field lines is called the Earth's magnetosphere. The magnetosphere extends into the vacuum of space, on average, from approximately 60 000 kilometres sunward, and trails out more than 300 000 kilometres away from the Sun in the magnetotail.",image:".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Magnetosphere_Ionosphere.webp",website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fsearch\u002Fmagnetosphere",summary:{years:[v,t,r,s,q,o,m,l,e,d,g,h,j,i,c,b,f,k,p],numberOfProducts:a,numberOfProjects:a,numberOfVariables:84},variables:[{name:"Aurora",description:"Occurence of fluorescence of the upper atmosphere through ionization by energetic charged particles accelerated by the Earth's magnetic field.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Cosmic ray neutron flux",description:"Flux of neutrons near the surface of Earth due to collisions in the atmosphere of cosmic rays impacting Earth atmosphere from the Sun and outer space.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Electron integral directional flux",description:"Flux density of low-, medium-, and high-energy electrons from the magnetosphere, the radiation belts or the interplanetary medium, per unit solid angle.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Solar UV flux",description:"Integrated UV flux over the solar disk.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Solar X-ray flux spectrum",description:"Energy spectrum of the X-ray flux integrated over the solar disk.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Earth Rotation",description:"Rotation velocity of the Earth, determining the length of the day - Physical unit: [Rad\u002Fs] - Accuracy unit: [Arcsec\u002Fcentury].",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Radio-waves",description:"Travelling radio-waves of solar, galactic and extragalactic origin, entering the Earth’s environment.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Solar wind velocity",description:"Vector velocity of solar wind plasma",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Cosmic ray neutron flux spectrum",description:"Flux density energy spectrum of neutrons from the Sun or as component of the cosmic radiation.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Solar H-alpha image",description:"Image of the Sun in the Hydrogen-alpha transition wavelength (656.3 nm).",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Solar wind temperature",description:"Temperature of solar wind protons",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"NIR\u002FSWIR flux spectrum",description:"Energy spectrum of diffuse NIR\u002FSWIR flux measured in space",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Proton differential directional flux",description:"Flux density energy spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-energy protons from the magnetosphere, the radiation belts or the interplanetary medium, per unit solid angle.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"X-ray sky image",description:"X-ray image of the sky",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"foF2",description:"Critical frequency of the F2 layer of the ionosphere.
