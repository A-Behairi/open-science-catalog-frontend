From the Level 1 brightness temperatures we derive the Level-2 data products, namely surface soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (VOD) (over land) and sea surface salinity (over oceans). SMOS not only contributes towards our understanding of the global water cycle, but also has the potential to improve our understanding of the global carbon cycle. The assimilation of SMOS soil moisture into a carbon assimilation scheme built around a terrestrial biosphere model was found to improve global CO2 flux estimates. Similarly, assimilating SMOS soil moisture and AMSR-E C-band VOD data into an evapotranspiration (ET) model was found to improve ET and root-zone soil moisture estimates over Australia.However, there is still a lack of in-depth understanding of the VOD product, and its potential to monitor vegetation properties and processes has not yet been satisfactorily explored. In this context, this activity aims to increase the scientific return of the SMOS VOD data product by preparing and promoting its use for vegetation applications in the fields of agriculture, drought monitoring and land surface modeling.\n","osc:name":bC,"osc:themes":[A],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:bl,"e-mail":bm},"osc:consortium":["THE INVERSION LAB THOMAS KAMINSKI CONSULTING (DE)","LUND UNIVERSITY (SE)",bA],"osc:type":J,start_datetime:"2016-05-10",end_datetime:"2018-12-15",datetime:"2016-05-10T00:00:00Z"},geometry:C,links:[{rel:n,href:"http:\u002F\u002Fsmos-veg.inversion-lab.com\u002Findex.html",title:K},{rel:n,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fsmos-vegetation\u002F",title:L},{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-146.json",type:b,title:"Gridded_Africa_SMOS level 3 products CATDS"},{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-147.json",type:b,title:"VOD_Africa_SMOS IC products CATDS"},{rel:E,href:B,type:b},{rel:z,href:o,type:b},{rel:F,href:aR,type:b},{rel:G,href:o,type:b}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-125.xml",roles:[M]}},stac_extensions:[H]};aZ[20]={type:I,stac_version:D,id:"project-76",properties:{title:"STREAM",description:"A quality assessment of STREAM runoff estimates has been pursued at multiple pilot basins across the world (5 large basins + multiple sub-basins) characterised by different physiographic\u002Fclimatic features.

In the natural system the balance among carbon in the atmosphere, land and ocean is regulated through fluxes between these three main reservoirs. In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades. Understanding the patterns of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean and land and the processes associated to them such as CO2 fertilization, ocean acidification, changes in surface runoff of sediments, changes to wetlands and peatlands, warming of permafrost, and changes to natural disturbance regimes, are critical to improving knowledge of the carbon cycle, its direct and indirect impacts on society and identifying approaches to mitigate and adapt for its
