OVALIE",description:"Global mean sea level rise is one of the most direct consequences of actual global warming. Since the beginning of the 20th century, global mean sea level experiences an unabated increase of 1.1-1.9 mm.yr-1 recorded by tide gauges. Based on satellite altimetry and since 1993, global mean sea level rises at a higher rate of 3 mm.yr-1. This higher rate denotes a possible acceleration in this global rise. Actual global mean sea level rise mainly reflects global ocean warming (through thermal expansion of sea water) and land ice melt (from Greenland, Antarctica and mountain glaciers). Monitoring precisely these climate variables is mandatory to better understand processes at work under current global warming and to validate climate models used for projections. The OVALIE project proposes to scientifically investigate and partition the respective contribution of the atmospheric forced variability versus the oceanic intrinsic variability for the sea level observations (satellite data -based on Topex\u002FPoseidon, Jason 1-2-3, ERS1, ERS2, ENVISAT, Altika and GRACE- and in situ measurements –based on Argo floats and other in situ measurements).\n","osc:name":"OVALIE: Oceanic intrinsic Variability versus Atmospheric forced variabiLIty of sea level changE","osc:themes":[z],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:at,"e-mail":au},"osc:consortium":[av],"osc:type":H,start_datetime:"2018-10-17",end_datetime:an,datetime:"2018-10-17T00:00:00Z"},geometry:v,links:[{rel:d,href:bx,title:I},{rel:d,href:bx,title:J},{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-101.json",type:b,title:"Sea level trends over 1993-2015 and 2005-2015 from the OCCIPUT ensemble simulation"},{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-102.json",type:b,title:"Atmospherically-forced and chaotic interannual variability of the sea level and its components over 1993-2015 from the OCCIPUT ensemble simulations"},{rel:C,href:A,type:b},{rel:u,href:h,type:b},{rel:D,href:bs,type:b},{rel:E,href:h,type:b}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-95.xml",roles:[K]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bw[1]={type:G,stac_version:B,id:"project-66",properties:{title:"(LPF) PHYSIOGLOB",description:"Assessing the inter-annual physiological response of phytoplankton to global warming using long-term satellite observations","osc:name":"PHYSIOGLOB: Assessing the inter-annual physiological response of phytoplankton to global warming using long-term satellite observations","osc:themes":[z],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:at,"e-mail":au},"osc:consortium":["ITALIAN NATIONAL AGENCY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES","ENERGY AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (ENEA) (IT)"],"osc:type":H,start_datetime:"2018-10-01",end_datetime:an,datetime:"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z"},geometry:v,links:[{rel:d,href:by,title:I},{rel:d,href:by,title:J},{rel:c,href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fproducts\u002Fproduct-103.json",type:b,title:"Secchi Disk depth_Global Oceans_Multimission"},{rel:C,href:A,type:b},{rel:u,href:h,type:b},{rel:D,href:bm,type:b},{rel:E,href:h,type:b}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-34.xml",roles:[K]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bw[2]={type:G,stac_version:B,id:"project-98",properties:{title:"(LPF) SMOWS",description:"How salinity impacts the formation of sub-surface waters (Mode Waters) in the South-West Pacific Ocean","osc:name":"SMOWS: Satellite Mode Waters Salinity, in synergy with Temperature and Sea Level","osc:themes":[z],"osc:status":Q,"osc:technical_officer":{name:at,"e-mail":au},"osc:consortium":[av],"osc:type":H,start_datetime:"2018-10-09",end_datetime:an,datetime:"2018-10-09T00:00:00Z"},geometry:v,links:[{rel:d,href:bz,title:I},{rel:d,href:bz,title:J},{rel:C,href:A,type:b},{rel:u,href:h,type:b},{rel:D,href:bq,type:b},{rel:E,href:h,type:b}],assets:{"iso-metadata":{href:"https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fiso\u002Fproject-18.xml",roles:[K]}},stac_extensions:[F]};bw[3]={type:G,stac_version:B,id:"project-6",properties:{title:"AEOLUS+INNOVATION -

In the natural system the balance among carbon in the atmosphere, land and ocean is regulated through fluxes between these three main reservoirs. In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades. Understanding the patterns of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean and land and the processes associated to them such as CO2 fertilization, ocean acidification, changes in surface runoff of sediments, changes to wetlands and peatlands, warming of permafrost, and changes to natural disturbance regimes, are critical to improving knowledge of the carbon cycle, its direct and indirect impacts on society and identifying approaches to mitigate and adapt for its consequences.",image:".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Land.webp",website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F31\u002Fa-collaboration-on-carbon-science-just-kicked-off\u002F",summary:{years:[L,x,y,w,s,q,p,i,g,k,l,n,m,f,e,j,o,t,O],numberOfProducts:a,numberOfProjects:a,numberOfVariables:35},variables:[{name:"Snow status (wet\u002Fdry)",description:"Binary product (dry or melting\u002Fthawing) expressing the presence of liquid water in a snow layer- Accuracy expressed as Hit Rate [ HR ] and False Alarm Rate [ FAR ].",summary:{years:[e,j],numberOfProducts:r}},{name:"Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)",description:"Difference between maximum (in NIR) and minimum (around the Red) vegetation reflectance, normalised to the summation.

Ocean is one key gearing of this complex engine. However, knowledge gaps remain in order to better understand, characterize and monitor its role in all major Earth System global cycles (e.g. water, energy, gas, and in particular carbon, momentum cycles…). To fill these gaps, dedicated research activities are needed, embracing a large number of disciplines as physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, ecology, and further exploring the interaction of the ocean with the other components of the Earth System, in particular the atmosphere, the land, and the cryosphere. To make the best of it, this research shall be based on the optimal and synergistic exploitation of all available observing systems (EO satellite data, in-situ and citizen observations), advanced modelling capabilities, interdisciplinary research and new technologies.","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2019\u002F11\u002F11\u002Fcollaboration-ocean-science\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-121.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-59.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-62.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-23.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-61.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-120.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-127.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-118.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-26.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-126.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-92.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-8.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-49.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-21.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-25.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-22.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-6.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-85.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-28.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-7.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-125.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-47.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-27.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-34.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-10.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-66.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-24.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-17.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-75.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-98.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-95.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-116.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-119.json","https:\u002F\u002Feoepca.github.io\u002Fopen-science-catalog-metadata\u002Fprojects\u002Fproject-42.json",".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Oceans.webp",Array(34),"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fovalie-oceanic-intrinsic-variability-versus-atmospheric-forced-variability-of-sea-level-change\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fphysioglob\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Fsmows-satellite-mode-waters-salinity-in-synergy-with-temperature-and-sea-level\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Faeolus-innovation-ocean-sub-surface-products-and-applications\u002F","CNR-RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GEO-HYDROLOGICAL PROTECTION ‚ IRPI (IT)","https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002Fprojects\u002Faeolus-innovation-expro-cdom-proxy-retrieval-from-aeolus-observations-color\u002F","Christian Retscher","christian.retscher@esa.int","Verisk Analytics GmbH (DE)","KNMI (NL)","Arctic + Salinity","BALTIC+ SEAL -
