In the natural system the balance among carbon in the atmosphere, land and ocean is regulated through fluxes between these three main reservoirs. In addition to these natural components, there are the contributions to the atmosphere from human activities, namely, fossil fuel burning, cement production, and a range of land management practices. Over the past 250 years, the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration has increased by roughly 45% from its pre-industrial value of roughly 280 parts per million by volume (ppm). In the same timeframe, atmospheric methane (CH4), a greenhouse gas 28 times more powerful than CO2 has more than doubled due to human activities, responsible for approx. 60% of total emissions, and, after a hiatus, is rising faster than at any time in the last two decades. Understanding the patterns of exchanges of carbon between the atmosphere, ocean and land and the processes associated to them such as CO2 fertilization, ocean acidification, changes in surface runoff of sediments, changes to wetlands and peatlands, warming of permafrost, and changes to natural disturbance regimes, are critical to improving knowledge of the carbon cycle, its direct and indirect impacts on society and identifying approaches to mitigate and adapt for its consequences.",image:".\u002Fimages\u002FEO_Land.webp",website:"https:\u002F\u002Feo4society.esa.int\u002F2020\u002F01\u002F31\u002Fa-collaboration-on-carbon-science-just-kicked-off\u002F",summary:{years:[v,t,u,s,r,o,n,g,f,i,j,l,k,e,d,h,m,q,x],numberOfProducts:a,numberOfProjects:a,numberOfVariables:35},variables:[{name:"Glacier topography",description:"Map of the height of the glacier surface.",summary:{years:[g,f,i,j,l,k,e,d],numberOfProducts:z}},{name:"Soil type",description:"Result of the classification of different types of soil within an area - Accuracy expressed as inverse of the number of classes, so that smaller figures correspond to better performance.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Vegetation type",description:"Result of the classification of different types of vegetation within a vegetated area - Accuracy expressed as inverse of the number of classes, so that smaller figures correspond to better performance.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Permafrost",description:ah,summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"River discharge",description:"Volume of water flowing through a river per unit of time",summary:{years:[l,k,e,d,h,m,q],numberOfProducts:23}},{name:"Evapotranspiration",description:"Quantity of water evaporated from\nthe soil and plants when the ground is at its natural moisture content.",summary:{years:[],numberOfProducts:a}},{name:"Soil temperature",description:"The standard depths for soil temperature measurements\nare 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm below the\nsurface; additional depths may be included.

gases are produced and destructed by physical, biological and chemical processes. This natural cycle has been perturbed over the past decades by the global population increase and by the related boost of anthropogenic activities. The composition of the atmosphere is undergoing major and rapid changes with significant impacts on a global scale, affecting the environment and human health. Funding agencies and the scientific community have been putting enormous efforts into studying the impact of these changes. Nonetheless, there is still a need to fill knowledge gaps and enhance the understanding of precursors and the formation mechanisms of the different atmospheric compounds and the relative contribution of biogenic and anthropogenic sources and sinks to their global budget.
